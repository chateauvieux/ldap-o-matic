# ldap-o-matic
LDAP-o-matic (a.k.a MIG, the Metamerge Information Gateway) is a web-powered directory-enabling application. It defines customizable views over directory data by grouping directory attributes in high-level data classes. Moreover, it gives a full control of the manner that this information will be accessed through Internet/Intranet/Extranet networks.

In other words, Metamerge Information Gateway provides several tools to organize, retrieve, update and control access over directory information. It is modular enough to be adapted to any organization needs. MIG is written in PHP and can run on many popular web servers. It is still a project, and developers are welcome.
